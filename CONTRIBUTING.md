In order to optimize the chances of your submission being accepted without much hassle, please take the time to review [the project's wiki](https://github.com/Neolander/numerical-cookbook/wiki) and make sure that you understand, agree with and abide by what is written in there.

That is all for now. If we see that a specific "contribution FAQ" emerges over time, we will be sure to put such cherry-picked project documentation items in there.
